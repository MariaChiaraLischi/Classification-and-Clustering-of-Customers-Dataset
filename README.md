# Data Analysis for Business Project 1
This project was completed as part of the coursework for the course Data Analysis for Business during the Bachelor’s degree program in Management and Computer Science at Luiss Guido Carli University.

The project focused on two parts: classification and clustering. In the first part, a customer dataset was used to build predictive models for identifying potential credit card account closures, allowing banks to proactively retain customers. The second part involved clustering customer purchasing behaviors from a Portuguese retailer to identify similar groups. 

### Part I: Classification
The dataset contains information about bank customers. The script is udeful to build multiple models to predict whether a customer will close his credit card account, in that case the bank may try to propose more convenient services and prevent the client from leaving the bank.

### Part II: Clustering
The dataset contains information about annual customers’ purchases from a Portuguese wholesale retailer. The script is useful to find homogeneous groups of customers with similar purchasing behaviours based on quantitative variables only.
