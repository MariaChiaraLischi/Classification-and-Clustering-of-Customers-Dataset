# Data Analysis for Business Projects
This project was completed as part of the coursework for the course Data Analysis for Business during the Bachelor’s degree program in Management and Computer Science at Luiss Guido Carli University.

This project is divided into two parts. The first (midterm) focuses on classification and clustering. Using a customer dataset, predictive models were built to identify potential credit card account closures, allowing banks to retain customers proactively. The clustering component analyzed purchasing behaviors from a Portuguese retailer to identify similar customer groups. The second part (final) involved an automobile dataset, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling of car prices, followed by clustering to classify car types based on their attributes.

## Midterm
### Part I: Classification
The dataset contains information about bank customers. The script is udeful to build multiple models to predict whether a customer will close his credit card account, in that case the bank may try to propose more convenient services and prevent the client from leaving the bank.

### Part II: Clustering
The dataset contains information about annual customers’ purchases from a Portuguese wholesale retailer. The script is useful to find homogeneous groups of customers with similar purchasing behaviours based on quantitative variables only.

## Final
The dataset contains information about automobiles: each of the 205 observations represents a different car model, with details about its features and price.

The script is useful to:
- prepare the dataset for subsequent analysis by cleaning it and encoding categorical values;
- conduct an explanatory data analysis to understand variables and their correlations;
- build and compare multiple predictive models for cars' prices based on their characteristics;
- apply, visualize and compare many clusterizations of car types based on selected covariates.
